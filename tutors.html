                <p>
                    She has qualified as an Early Years Practitioner and holds the NNEB, NVQ 4 in Childcare and
                    Education and a TEFL teaching qualification.

                <p>
                    She has worked with children for over twenty five years in a variety of childcare settings, during
                    which she worked with children who use sign language to communicate. She has also worked as an
                    Educational Needs coordinator in one of her roles.
                </P>
                <p>
                    She now uses this experience to teach our younger learners the basic signs necessary to communicate
                    with their friends at school and family members. These fun lessons are a great introduction to sign
                    language and many have gone on to complete their Level 1 after this course has been completed.
