## About

This is a User Centric Development Milstone Project website created as part of a Full Stack Software Development in Code Institute by [Michael Greenberry](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-greenberry-637299108/).

I created this static website to provide a fun and engaging way of learning British Sign Language. This website is aimed at families wanting to learn British Sign Language.

The website targets both parents/guardians and their children, along with other adults or children, who would like to learn British Sign Language. The goal of this website is to provide information on British Sign Language, offer lessons at all ages in the family and provide them with sample videos and tutor information to give them confidence in returning to the website and booking lessons and courses provided by the business owener.

This website must be engaging for the target audience and contain the information needed to complet the goals of the business owner and site visitors. It must also stand out and be memorable for future visits and for recommendations to other families or potential users.

## UX (User Experience)

For this website and business I looked online for family friendly sign language courses for British Sign Language (BSL). I found a few companies that provided sign language for babies and adults, but very few that provided for the whole family. Some of the websites taught sign language using Signed Supported English, or Makaton. However, I wanted to provide a website that would cover all ages and still provide a rich and meaningful experience. I choose British Sign Language as it is used by over 125,000 people use BSL as their first or preferred language.

### Project Goals
* To provide a easy to understand website for the user to learn British Sign Language (BSL)
* To introduce Happy Hands, a child friendly website in British Sign Language
* To provide British Sign Language lessons to children and their families
* To provide a brief explanation about British Sign Language (BSL)
* To provide a contact form for more information
* To provide a downloadable pdf fingerspelling document
* To demonstrate some sample lessons on video
* To provide a BSL translation of all internet pages

### Design Choices

#### Typography

For fonts, I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) for my website. 

I have chosen the font-family: ['Poppins'](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins/), sans-serif; for the Headings and Menu sections of the website as it is easy to read and has a nice cursive font which matches the style of the website. I also felt this fitted in well with the child and family friendly design of the website.

I've chosen the font-family: ['Roboto'](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto/), monospace; for the paragraph and other aspects of the site as it is a good match and pairs well with the Poppins font. 

#### Colours

For this website I chose a colour pallette that matched similar websites that are colourful and child friendly. The background colour is Aqua, the headers is navy and menus, some text and buttons are yellow as a good contrast to the main colour.

The colours I picked are as follows: -

Format: ![Coolors Palette](https://coolors.co/cbf3f0-ffe66d-3066be)

### Wireframes
I undertook a number of steps to design this website. I have created a breakdown of tasks completed each day in this [document](website-design-steps)

I have attached mock ups of the original ideas and final design ideas before I used Wireframes to create a prototype.

## Features
Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Features Left to Implement
Another feature idea
### Existing Creative

### Features Left To Implement

## Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.
* [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
* [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)
* [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Wireframes with Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/)
* [Github](https://github.com/)
* [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/)

## Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
## Development
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
### How to implement this locally
you should also describe how to run your code locally.
