## About

This is a User Centric Development Milstone Project website created as part of a Full Stack Software Development in Code Institute by [Michael Greenberry](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-greenberry-637299108/).

I created this static website to provide a fun and engaging way of learning British Sign Language. This website is aimed at families wanting to learn British Sign Language.

The website targets both parents/guardians and their children, along with other adults or children, who would like to learn British Sign Language. The goal of this website is to provide information on British Sign Language, offer lessons at all ages in the family and provide them with sample videos and tutor information to give them confidence in returning to the website and booking lessons and courses provided by the business owener.

This website must be engaging for the target audience and contain the information needed to complet the goals of the business owner and site visitors. It must also stand out and be memorable for future visits and for recommendations to other families or potential users.

## UX (User Experience)

For this website and business I looked online for family friendly sign language courses for British Sign Language (BSL). I found a few companies that provided sign language for babies and adults, but very few that provided for the whole family. Some of the websites taught sign language using Signed Supported English, or Makaton. However, I wanted to provide a website that would cover all ages and still provide a rich and meaningful experience. I choose British Sign Language as it is used by over 125,000 people use BSL as their first or preferred language.

### Project Goals
* To provide a easy to understand website for the user to learn British Sign Language (BSL)
* To introduce Happy Hands, a child friendly website in British Sign Language
* To provide British Sign Language lessons to children and their families
* To provide a brief explanation about British Sign Language (BSL)
* To provide a contact form for more information
* To provide a downloadable pdf fingerspelling document
* To demonstrate some sample lessons on video
* To provide a BSL translation of all internet pages

### Design Choices

#### Typography

For fonts, I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) for my website. 

I have chosen the font-family: ['Poppins'](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins/), sans-serif; for the Headings and Menu sections of the website as it is easy to read and has a nice cursive font which matches the style of the website. I also felt this fitted in well with the child and family friendly design of the website.

I've chosen the font-family: ['Roboto'](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto/), monospace; for the paragraph and other aspects of the site as it is a good match and pairs well with the Poppins font. 

#### Colours

For this website I chose a colour pallette that matched similar websites that are colourful and child friendly. The background colour is Aqua, the headers is navy and menus, some text and buttons are yellow as a good contrast to the main colour.

The colours I picked are as follows: -

### Icons

All icons for Social Media were sourced form [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

### Layout

This website is designed with access from the home page to all other pages from the navigation bar. Some pages also include links to other pages, i.e. index.html links to both lessons.html and tutors.html. 

However, the 404.html and the success.html pages are not accessed from the navigation bar or from any of the pages of the website. The 404.html page only displays when a user enters or searches for a page that doens't exist. The success.html page only displays when a user has sucessfully completed the contact form in contact-us.html. Both the 404.html and the success.html pages allow the user to navigate to the main website.

![blueprint](/assets/images/readme-images/website-layout-plans.jpg) This blueprint was then used to design the navigation and call-out buttons featured in the website.

## Wireframes
I have attached mock ups of the original ideas and final design ideas before I used Wireframes to create a prototype. These initial drawings and ideas are [here](assets/images/readme-images/initial-ideas.pdf)

I used Balsamiq to create my wireframes. I chose to do a mobile version first with the pages I wanted and then create a desktop version after. I did this as this was going to be the way I designed my website, mobile first.

The following wireframes:

Samsung Phone
* [index.html](assets/images/readme-images/hhmobile-index.png)
* [lessons.html](assets/images/readme-images/hhmobile-lessons.png)
* [faqandcontact.html](assets/images/readme-images/hhmobile-faq-contactus.png)

Apple iPad
* I didn't create an iPad version before I started my website but once I had an index.html, I went back to finalise my design.

Generic laptop
* [index.html](assets/images/readme-images/hhdesktop-index.png)
* [lessons.html](assets/images/readme-images/hhdesktop-lessons.png)
* [faqandcontact.html](assets/images/readme-images/hhdesktop-faq-contact.png)

Once I started to create my website I realised I needed a lot more content and that I wanted to have a separate page for the contact-us section. I also decided to add a tutor.html, success.html for the form and a 404.html for wrong address input:

As I wanted to include this on all formats and devices I created my wireframes again for all pages and added the following to show mobile, tablet and desktop:

* [index.html](/assets/images/readme-images/index.html.png)
* [lessons.html](/assets/images/readme-images/lessons.html.png)
* [tutors.html](/assets/images/readme-images/tutors.html.png)
* [download.html](/assets/images/readme-images/download.html.png)
* [contact-us.html](/assets/images/readme-images/contact-us.html.png)

### Icons
All icons for Social Media were sourced form [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
### Code
This [Bootstrap - Nav Bar](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/navbar/) page was used to produce the type of navigation menu I wanted. This was then adapted for my use.

#### HTPS
> <nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-dark bg-primary">
            <a class="navbar-brand" href="index.html">
                <img class="happy-hands" src="assets/images/logos-images/happy-hands.jpg" alt="Happy Hands Logo"></a>
            <h6 class="yellow">Happy Hands</h6>
            <button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#navbarSurpportedContent"
                aria-controls="navbarSurpportedContent" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation">
                <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>
            </button>
            <div class="collapse navbar-collapse justify-content-end" id="navbarSurpportedContent">
                <ul class="yellow navbar-nav">
                    <li class="nav-item active">
                        <a class="nav-link" href="index.html">Home</a>
                    </li>
                    <li class="nav-item">
                        <a class="nav-link" href="lessons.html">Lessons</a>
                    </li>
                    <li class="nav-item">
                        <a class="nav-link" href="tutors.html">Tutors</a>
                    </li>
                    <li class="nav-item">
                        <a class="nav-link" href="download.html">Free Content</a>
                    </li>
                    <li class="nav-item">
                        <a class="nav-link" href="contact-us.html">Contact Us</a>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </nav>

#### CSS
    .navbar-toggler-icon {
    /* From Bootstrap*/
    display: inline-block;
    width: 5em;
    height: 5em;
    vertical-align: middle;
    content: "";
    background: 50%/100% 100% no-repeat;
    }

[Bootstrap - Buttons](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/buttons/) was used to provide ideas and some code was used and adapted to create my buttons (call-outs).
> .btn {/*influenced by Bootstrap*/}

The Hero image by itself was too bright for the strapline and heading. To adjust the **'background-image'** I adapted some code found at [CSS-Tricks.com](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/background-image/).
     
     .hero-image {
     background: url(../images/logos-images/happy-hands.jpg) no-repeat center center;
     background-image: linear-gradient(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.40),
            rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.40)),
        url(../images/logos-images/happy-hands.jpg);
     /*background-image influenced by css-tricks.com*/
     background-size: cover;
     height: 36rem;
     width: 100%;
     position: relative;
     }

The YouTube videos were not responsive when the screen was changed from a mobile device to a laptop. To adjust the size of the video and make it responsive for all devices I used part of the code found at [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35814653/automatic-height-when-embedding-a-youtube-video/54924505#54924505)

    .video {
    /* Credit - https://stackoverflow.com/a/54924505 */
    position: relative;
    padding-bottom: 56.25%;
    height: 0;
    }
